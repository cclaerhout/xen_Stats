All these Bb Codes are using the jQuery plugin named "[URL='http://www.jqplot.com/']jqPlot[/URL]". This JavaScript library is simply amazing. Its author, [EMAIL='chris@jqplot.com']Chris Leonello[/EMAIL], has succeeded to make a very, very, very complete script with an impressive number of renderers and options.

A "renderer" is simply an engine used for all the different parts of the chart: you want to draw a curve, it will use the curve renderer, you want to make a bar chart, it will use the bar renderer, you want to add some axis/legends/ticks, it will also use their own renderers, etc. jQplot has lots of "renderers" and each renderer has [S]a lot of[/S] a crazy amount of options (see the [URL='http://www.jqplot.com/docs/files/usage-txt.html']API documentation[/URL]).

All the available options have not been implemented in these Bb Codes, but they still have a substantial number of them. You will see by yourself when you will read the Faq. That specificity makes really hard to make some User Interfaces for the [URL='http://xenforo.com/community/resources/tinymce-quattro-and-its-wysiwyg-bbcodes.1881']TinyMCE Quattro addon[/URL].
